# Simple example of using chartkick in a Sinatra app.

Based on this
[example](https://www.howtobuildsoftware.com/index.php/how-do/c2YK/sinatra-chartkick-sinatra-and-chartkick-example),
which is slightly out of date.

This is the minimum I could do to create a working chartkick chart in a Sinatra
app.
